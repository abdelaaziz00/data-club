### ðŸ”„ In Progress

   - Implement proper connection handling

2. **Authentication System**
   - Complete signup functionality
   - Implement logout system
   - Add password hashing for security

3. **Basic Layout**
   - Create header.php and footer.php
   - Implement navigation system
   - Add basic CSS styling

#### Phase 2: User Management
1. **User Dashboard**
   - User profile management
   - Club browsing functionality
   - Event viewing

2. **Admin Panel**
   - User management interface
   - Club approval system
   - Event management

#### Phase 3: Club & Event System
1. **Club Management**

## Database Schema (Current)
Based on the login.php implementation, the system uses:
- `admin` table: `ID_ADMIN`, `EMAIL`, `PASSWORD`
- `member` table: `ID_MEMBER`, `EMAIL`, `PASSWORD`

## Development Notes
- **Current Approach:** Monolithic PHP structure with embedded database logic
- **Security Considerations:** Passwords are currently stored in plain text (needs hashing)
- **Session Management:** Basic session-based authentication implemented
- **File Organization:** All PHP files in `public/` are entry points called directly by browser

## Next Steps
1. Extract database configuration to separate file
2. Implement password hashing
3. Create basic layout templates (header/footer)
4. Add user registration functionality
5. Implement proper redirects after login

## Technical Requirements
- **Server:** XAMPP (Apache + MySQL + PHP)
- **Database:** MySQL (data_club database)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP with MySQLi
